# Coursera-DataScience-course8
It is an assignment of Coursera Data Science, the dataset has been provided.

In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to evaluate how well a person do a particular activity. 

(1)Firstly, I will extract useful features from the training and testing dataset. 

(2)Then I will use training dataset to train our models and envaluate the performance of each model accordingly. 

(3)Finally, I will choose the best model to make predictions in our testing dataset.

The report is written by R markdown, and all the analysis process and result can be seen in MachineLearningPrediction.html
